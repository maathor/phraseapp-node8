# phraseapp-node8

## Why ?

I use this image to build front (react/js/...) into statics pages page with gitlab runner.

## What did it contains ?

Based from `node:8.16.0-alpine`, it contains :
  - Node 8
  - python3
  - pip for python3
  - aws cli, I like to send my static page on s3 (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fr_fr/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html)
  
All issues are welcome !
